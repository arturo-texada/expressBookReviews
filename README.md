#Final Project - Book Review Application
#Estimated Time Needed: 2 hours
#In this final project, we will build a server-side online book review application and integrate it with a secure REST API server which will use authentication at the session level using JWT. You will #then test your application using Promises callbacks or Async-Await functions.
#Objectives:
#After completing this lab, you will be able to:

#Create APIs and perform CRUD operations on an Express server using Session & JWT authentication.
#Use Async/Await or Promises with Axios in Node.js.
#Create REST API endpoints and test them using Postman.


#Prerequisite: You need to complete the following two labs before starting the final project.
#Hands-on Lab - CRUD operations with Node.js.
#Practice Project - CRUD operations on Express server with JWT & Session Authentication.
#Part A: Fork the Git repository to have the server side book review application code you need to start
#Create your own copy of the git repository which has the code you need to start the project.
#Clone the repository into the theia environment.
#Part B: npm install the necessary packages and Postman Login
#Change to the express JS server directory and install all the packages required in your local environment for the server to run.
#Use your Google mail credentials to register or log in with Postman and test the API endpoints for your final project.
#Part C: Implementing Authentication for using the Book Review application
#You will create access restrictions to some endpoints using JWT and session level authentication.
#Part D: Access the book review application as general purpose user and register user
#General user can access all the books available in the shop and get all books based on ISBN,Author,Title,Review.
#Once a user register with the app, they are able to add or modify and delete book reviews.
#Part E: Use Async/Await or Promises with Axios in Node.js for each of the four CRUD Operations.
#Using the async,callback function, retrieve all books. Using Promises, search for the book by ISBN and then search by author or title.
#Now test the API endpoints using Postman.
